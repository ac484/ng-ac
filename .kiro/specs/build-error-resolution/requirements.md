# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical build errors in the DDD architecture refactoring project. The Angular application currently fails to build due to multiple TypeScript errors including missing exports, type incompatibilities, missing method implementations, and structural issues with the domain model. The goal is to systematically resolve all build errors while maintaining the integrity of the Domain-Driven Design architecture and ensuring type safety throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Angular application to build successfully without TypeScript errors, so that I can continue development and deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `ng build --configuration=development` THEN the system SHALL complete without any TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL generate a valid application bundle
3. WHEN TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety across all modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all domain entities and value objects to be properly exported and importable, so that the application modules can reference them correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing Contract entity THEN the system SHALL provide the exported Contract class
2. WHEN importing ContractVersion entity THEN the system SHALL provide the exported ContractVersion class  
3. WHEN importing ContractSearchCriteria value object THEN the system SHALL provide the exported class
4. WHEN importing from shared modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all exports without ambiguity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the ContractAggregate to have a proper public interface, so that application and infrastructure layers can interact with it correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a ContractAggregate THEN the system SHALL provide a public constructor or factory method
2. WHEN accessing contract properties THEN the system SHALL provide direct property access without nested .contract property
3. WHEN the aggregate is used in repositories THEN the system SHALL support proper instantiation and data access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all domain service methods to be implemented, so that application services can perform business operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling findContractById THEN the ContractDomainService SHALL return an Observable of ContractAggregate
2. WHEN calling findContractsByStatus THEN the ContractDomainService SHALL return an Observable of ContractAggregate array
3. WHEN calling findContractsByClient THEN the ContractDomainService SHALL return an Observable of ContractAggregate array
4. WHEN calling deleteContract THEN the ContractDomainService SHALL perform contract deletion logic
5. WHEN calling getContractStats THEN the ContractDomainService SHALL return contract statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all entities to properly implement the AggregateRoot interface, so that the repository pattern works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ContractVersionEntity implements AggregateRoot THEN the system SHALL include the required version property
2. WHEN UserEntity implements AggregateRoot THEN the system SHALL include the required version property
3. WHEN entities are used in repositories THEN the system SHALL satisfy all interface constraints

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type handling for dates and timestamps, so that Firebase integration works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with ContractVersion dates THEN the system SHALL use Firebase Timestamp type consistently
2. WHEN converting between Date and Timestamp THEN the system SHALL handle the conversion properly
3. WHEN persisting to Firestore THEN the system SHALL use compatible date types

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all value objects to properly override base class methods, so that TypeScript strict mode is satisfied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN value objects override toString() THEN the system SHALL include the override modifier
2. WHEN extending ValueObject base class THEN the system SHALL properly implement all required overrides
3. WHEN TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL compile without override-related errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling that works across different JavaScript environments, so that the application is robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Error.captureStackTrace is not available THEN the system SHALL handle the absence gracefully
2. WHEN creating custom exceptions THEN the system SHALL work in both Node.js and browser environments
3. WHEN stack traces are captured THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error information
