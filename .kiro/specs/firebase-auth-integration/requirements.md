# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Firebase Authentication with the existing ng-alain/delon authentication system to provide a unified authentication experience. The integration will maintain the current ng-alain authentication flow while using Firebase Auth as the underlying authentication provider. All Firebase interactions must be handled through @angular/fire, ensuring proper token management, automatic refresh capabilities, and seamless integration with existing interceptors and guards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Firebase Auth to serve as the underlying authentication provider while maintaining ng-alain's existing authentication interface, so that the application can leverage Firebase's robust authentication features without breaking existing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN Firebase Auth SHALL be configured as the primary authentication provider
2. WHEN a user authenticates through Firebase THEN the Firebase ID token SHALL be automatically synchronized with Alain's token service
3. WHEN existing ng-alain authentication methods are called THEN they SHALL work seamlessly with Firebase Auth as the backend
4. IF Firebase Auth state changes THEN the Alain token service SHALL be automatically updated to reflect the new state
5. WHEN the application uses existing @delon/auth services THEN they SHALL continue to function without modification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in using Firebase authentication methods while experiencing the same UI and flow as the current ng-alain login system, so that the authentication experience remains consistent and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the login page THEN they SHALL see the existing ng-alain login interface
2. WHEN a user submits login credentials THEN Firebase Auth SHALL handle the authentication process
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the user SHALL be redirected using the existing ng-alain routing logic
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed using the existing error handling system
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN both Firebase Auth and Alain token service SHALL be cleared simultaneously

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Firebase ID tokens to be automatically attached to HTTP requests and refreshed when needed, so that API calls remain authenticated without manual token management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is made THEN the Firebase ID token SHALL be automatically attached to the Authorization header
2. WHEN a Firebase ID token expires THEN it SHALL be automatically refreshed before the next API call
3. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the login page
4. WHEN multiple simultaneous requests occur with an expired token THEN only one refresh request SHALL be made
5. IF a request fails due to authentication THEN the existing error handling interceptor SHALL process it appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing ng-alain guards and interceptors to work seamlessly with Firebase Auth, so that route protection and HTTP request handling continue to function without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a protected route is accessed THEN the existing authSimpleCanActivate guard SHALL verify Firebase authentication status
2. WHEN the authSimpleInterceptor processes requests THEN it SHALL use Firebase ID tokens for authentication
3. WHEN the default interceptor handles responses THEN it SHALL properly manage Firebase token refresh scenarios
4. IF authentication fails in a guard THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the login page as currently configured
5. WHEN route guards check authentication status THEN they SHALL receive accurate Firebase Auth state information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unified authentication state management that synchronizes Firebase Auth state with Alain's token service, so that authentication status is consistent across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase Auth state changes THEN Alain's DA_SERVICE_TOKEN SHALL be updated immediately
2. WHEN a user's Firebase token is refreshed THEN the new token SHALL be stored in Alain's token service
3. WHEN the application checks authentication status THEN it SHALL return consistent results from both Firebase Auth and Alain services
4. IF Firebase Auth indicates a user is logged out THEN Alain's token service SHALL also reflect the logged-out state
5. WHEN the application starts THEN Firebase Auth state SHALL be synchronized with Alain's token service during initialization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Firebase interactions to be handled exclusively through @angular/fire, so that the integration follows Angular best practices and maintains proper dependency injection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase Auth operations are performed THEN they SHALL use @angular/fire/auth services exclusively
2. WHEN Firebase tokens are accessed THEN they SHALL be retrieved through @angular/fire Auth service methods
3. WHEN Firebase Auth state is monitored THEN it SHALL use @angular/fire Auth service observables
4. IF direct Firebase SDK calls are needed THEN they SHALL be wrapped within @angular/fire service implementations
5. WHEN Firebase configuration is accessed THEN it SHALL use the existing Firebase app configuration from app.config.ts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication session to persist across browser sessions and be automatically restored when I return to the application, so that I don't need to log in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN their Firebase Auth session SHALL persist in browser storage
2. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL check for existing Firebase Auth sessions and restore them
3. WHEN a persisted session is restored THEN Alain's token service SHALL be updated with the current Firebase ID token
4. IF a persisted session is invalid or expired THEN the user SHALL be prompted to log in again
5. WHEN a user explicitly logs out THEN all session data SHALL be cleared from both Firebase Auth and browser storage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for Firebase Auth operations that integrates with the existing ng-alain error handling system, so that authentication errors are properly managed and displayed to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase Auth operations fail THEN errors SHALL be caught and processed by the existing error handling system
2. WHEN network errors occur during authentication THEN appropriate user-friendly messages SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN Firebase Auth returns specific error codes THEN they SHALL be mapped to appropriate user messages
4. IF token refresh fails THEN the error SHALL be handled gracefully without breaking the application
5. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately for debugging purposes
